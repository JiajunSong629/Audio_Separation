# Audio_Separation
Final Project for Duke ECE685D Fall 2020 (Introduction to Deep Learning), "Audio Separation Using Deep Neural Networks"

## Project Goal

The goal of this project is to use nonlinear techniques such as deep learning to separate audio sources from their mixed signal. The mixed signal may be a mixture of music background, dog barking, and siren voice.
